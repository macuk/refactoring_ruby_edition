# Refactoring Ruby Edition

This repo is step by step refactoring process based on example from Refactoring Ruby Edition book.

# Tips

When you find you have to add a feature to a program, and the programâ€™s code is not structured in a convenient way to add the feature, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.

Before you start refactoring, check that you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be self-checking.

Refactoring changes the programs in small steps. If you make a mistake, it is easy to find the bug.

Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
